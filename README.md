### Getting started
- NETS supports multi-dimensioned data. Given a set value ```R``` and ```k``` it determines an exact solution of outliers. NETS is used to detect outliers in a streaming window. 
- To use NETS, import the classes into any python project of choice. Make sure to read the parameters of NETS.
- A minor test-case can be configured to test NETS, simply run ```testNETS.py```.
